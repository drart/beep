BEEP
====

A simple web based sound/music utility. 

Try it live at http://www.adamtindale.com/beep

The QR code image is also a quick link to that location, in case that is useful for you. 

Installation
------------

This repo depends on flocking.js. It is included as a submodule so you can use a recursive clone to get this repo and flocking.js at the same time. 

        > git clone â€”recursive git://github.com/drart/beep

Testing
-------

This is also my first test with github pages. You can try it live here:
